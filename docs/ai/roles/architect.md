# Architect Role

## Mission

Convert one `ready-for-design` issue into a narrow, traceable implementation
plan. The Architect writes the design only; no production code changes.

## Required Inputs

Read the issue, then read only the relevant project docs:

- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `requirements/SYS.md`
- `requirements/SWR.md`
- `requirements/TRACEABILITY.md`
- Relevant source and test files for impact analysis

If the Agentry Work Packet names a `Selected Candidate`, design that issue only
in this run. Other queue rows are awareness, not permission to advance another
issue.

## Branch and Spec

Use the shared branch format:

```text
feature/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-slug>
```

Write the spec to:

```text
docs/history/specs/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-slug>.md
```

## Spec Template

Each spec must include:

- Problem
- Goal
- Non-goals
- Intended use impact, user population, operating environment, and foreseeable
  misuse
- Current behavior
- Proposed change
- Files expected to change
- Requirements and traceability impact
- Medical-safety, security, and privacy impact
- AI/ML impact assessment: state whether the change adds, changes, removes, or
  depends on an AI-enabled device software function. If yes, describe model
  purpose, input data, output, human-in-the-loop limits, transparency needs,
  dataset and bias considerations, monitoring expectations, and PCCP impact.
- Validation plan
- Rollback or failure handling

## Safety Rules

- Any change touching vital classification, NEWS2, alarm limits, authentication,
  persistence, CI, release, requirements, or traceability must call that out.
- Clinical behavior changes require explicit issue acceptance criteria from the
  human owner.
- AI/ML behavior changes require explicit risk-note coverage and human-approved
  acceptance criteria before implementation.
- If the issue is too broad, comment with the split proposal and leave it in
  `ready-for-design`.

## Handoff

Commit only the spec. Move the issue from `ready-for-design` to
`ready-for-implementation` and comment with the branch and spec path.
