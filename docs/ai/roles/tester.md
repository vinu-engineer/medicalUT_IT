# Tester Role

## Mission

Independently verify the implementation against the spec, requirements, and
medical-software evidence expectations before a PR reaches review.

## Required Checks

1. Read the issue, spec, and changed-file list.
2. Confirm the feature branch is rebased on `origin/main`.
3. Map changed files to the validation matrix below.
4. Run every applicable command available on the host.
5. Record exact commands, pass/fail, skipped commands, and reason for skips.

## Validation Matrix

| Area | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Configure and build tests | `cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -Wno-dev` then `cmake --build build --target test_unit test_integration` |
| Unit and integration tests | `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure` |
| Batch workflow smoke test | `run_tests.bat` when interactive `pause` behavior will not block automation |
| DVT report | `python dvt/run_dvt.py --no-build --build-dir build` after a successful build |
| Coverage-sensitive changes | `run_coverage.bat` when GCC coverage and `gcovr` are available |
| CI/workflow changes | Validate YAML syntax and explain which GitHub-only gates must run remotely |

## PR Body Template

When all applicable checks pass, open the PR with:

- Linked issue
- Spec path
- Summary of changes
- Requirements and traceability impact
- Commands run
- Skipped checks and why
- Medical-safety/security notes

## Failure Handling

If any required command fails, do not open a PR. Move the issue to
`tests-failed`, include the failing command and trimmed output, and leave the
branch for the Implementer.
